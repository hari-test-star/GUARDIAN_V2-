Guardian v2 üõ°Ô∏è

Guardian v2 is my first custom-built antivirus project,  
created for your security. It features a unique scout-based  
system that scans only selected folders, detects suspicious  
files based on dangerous extensions, and allows the user to  
manually choose whether to remove them.

The program supports 3 free scans without signing in,  
and unlimited scans after email verification using an  
offline MX DNS check. It is non-admin friendly, skipping  
inaccessible folders instead of failing, and includes an  
attack mode to search for and delete a specific file  
anywhere on the system.

Guardian also lists active applications once per scan  
for process awareness, and reinforces folder monitoring  
if repeated infections are detected. This antivirus is  
rated 9/10 by many intelligent AIs.

Built entirely in Python, this project uses only  
dnspython (for email verification) and psutil  
(for process handling), making it lightweight  
yet functional.

About the creator:

offensive and defensive security, has created his  
first yet powerful antivirus script. He has used the  
name Guardian v2 service instead of his own name.
